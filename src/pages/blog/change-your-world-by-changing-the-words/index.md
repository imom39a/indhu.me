The first rule in NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) is ‘You cannot not communicate’, which means you can never stay without communicating to others to survive.
There are different types of communication. The most famous classification is the verbal and the nonverbal communication. Similarly, we also have different communication style.

Understanding different communication styles and paying attention to which styles our teammates gravitate toward, can improve our interpersonal skills, build trust, and help us get more done with less frustration.

Understanding our differences – especially in the way we communicate – is actually an investment. The payoff is Stronger workplace relationships, which is a major predictor of employee engagement, stress less work environment and therefore, certainly productivity. 

### Communication styles are influenced by behavior traits

When figuring out how you can communicate effectively with someone, it’s important to understand their broader personal style. Are they direct? Analytical? Sociable? Business-like? Behavioral traits clue us into how people respond to information, which, in turn, helps us anticipate how to converse in a way that strengthens the relationship.
Here is a model by AUBREY BLANCHE, Global Head of Diversity & Belonging.
