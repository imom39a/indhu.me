Team building is a process of turning a group of individual employees into cohesive team. Team is a group of individuals with different styles and different personalities working together for a common goal or an objective.

Working together effectively requires collaboration within them. Doing so, the resulting bond will enable them to accomplish the work or goal more successful than the non-bonded group.

What makes a group a team? Knowing each other as persons; not just professionals.  For which you must
-	Initiate conversations, as it strengthens,
-	Lend ears to their stories by listening more
-	Most importantly, empathize
-	Try being helpful at need in any possible way

Here a trustful bond is created.

I would like to explain a tool which helps in building trust and personal development. It was developed by Joseph Luft and Haringam after their names the tool was called **JOHARI** window.

![JOHARI Window - 4 panes of self](./1.jpg)

There are four main areas in this window representing the information of individuals. Let’s discuss my Johari window.

The **OPNE AREA** has information which I know about me, the same is also known to people around me.

> Ex: I’m from India, I worked as a L&D professional.

The **BLIND AREA** or the shadow area represents information which I don’t know but people around me does. This could be information that I haven’t realized and received as feedback from others.
> Ex: I talk fast and had to slow down my speed.

The third one is the **HIDDEN AREA** which represents the information I’ve been hiding from others. 

> Ex: My hobbies, Allergies, do not like list 

The last area is the **UNKNOWN AREA**. As the name goes, this represents information unknow to me and to people around me. 

> Ex: If I’m recruited as L&D manager, my team won't know about my people management skills and what to expect from me.

These are unknow information; as I haven’t encountered an opportunity yet, to experience or disclose it.

To build a trustful relationship, the panes of the window must be moved to widen up the open area by changing the size of the window. The aim is to grow open area and shrink other areas to a necessary level.

To shrink hidden area, you must disclose few information. Not all but selective non work-related information can be concealed within professional team. 

To shrink blind spot, you must get the practice of receiving and giving effective feedback. With effective feedback loop, you will have new opportunities to encounter, new information which shrinks unknown area.

This way we can develop our interpersonal skills communication between team members, to evolve as a successful team.
