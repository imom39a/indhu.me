Have you come across this type of situation? 
Whenever our faculty ask us to present a PowerPoint or a seminar when they ask for volunteers… That when we all bend down and act as if we are busy with something else. Right? We keep avoiding it

The fear of public speaking is the most common phobia ahead of death, spiders, or heights. The National Institute of Mental Health reports that public speaking anxiety, or glossophobia, affects about 73% of the population. Some individuals may feel a slight nervousness at the very thought of public speaking, while others experience full-on panic and fear.

The front lobe is responsible for sorting memories and sensitivity. When you develop anxiety you also develop stress which affects recollecting memories. But the skill which we hesitate towards has brought more change in many people life Like 

- Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream speech” broke down racial barriers.
- President Nixon’s speech united a nation and put a man on the moon.
- Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address put him on the map for president. 
- Winston s. Churchill - at the outbreak of World War II
Throughout history, it has been public speaking that has united people and caused a great change.

[The Kings Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxBrTvLbBM) - This is an interesting movie that I would suggest to everyone, that implies the importance of public speaking.

I also do have a dream, to change the world, to contribute something to my society. I see that [Toastmasters](https://1274.toastmastersclubs.org/agenda.html?21whBY) is a wonderful platform, an opportunity where I can develop myself and create an identity. It helped me to
- Get organized
- Practice and practice
- Face Challenges
- Focus on the objective
- Be strong and courageous
- Get support
- Visualize my success 
- Recognize your success

I found my encouragement towards my dream. Hope you too have some dream of your own. So, let's embrace this skill and **Speak for the Change**.
